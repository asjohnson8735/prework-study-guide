# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

I created this study guide as a boot camp student so I can further learn HTML, CSS, Github, and JavaScript. It keeps a neat list of notes I can take to remember what I need to know, and is easy to update and add content to. Through making this study guide website, I furthered my knowledge on programming while making a useful tool to help me throughout the course.
